                    <h1>What is CI-CD?</h1>
                    CI-CD stands for Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment, sometimes referred to as Continuous Delivery. This principle is integral to
                    DevOps and it refers to the practice of building, testing, and deploying code continuously. CI-CD is meant to combat the issues that persist with
                    traditional application development methods, where issues with integrating new code are common. CI-CD avoids this by testing code as soon as it gets
                    pushed, and if it passes the tests, it will merge, then automatically release to the repository, and then deploy to production.

                    <h1>GitHub Actions</h1>
                    Github Actions allow us to implement the process of CI-CD into projects such as this one. They actually go a little bit further than DevOps because they allow
                    certain events such as a pull request to trigger workflows. Github does this via jobs, each of which run inside their own virtual machine/container known
                    as a runner. Jobs are sets of steps that reside in the yaml file that execute on the same runner. In this project, the Github actions check for the correct
                    Ubuntu version, Python version, the correct repository, and necessary dependencies:

                    <h1>Reviewing Code with a Dev Server</h1>
                    When creating web applications such as this one, it can be intuitive to have just the one master version, the one that all your customers/users will see and use.
                    However, what do you do when you want to deploy some new features or patches or other security vulnerabilities? You simply cannot test on the main version that
                    your users see. It is imperative that that version is always up and running so that your users do not experience an interruption in service. This is why we test
                    and review all modifications to the source code on a separate version of the application known as the Development server. It is identical to the main one, but
                    it's our sandbox to try out new variations of software changes before we implement them to the main server.

                    <h1>Deploying Master with a Prod Server</h1>
                    As mentioned above, in addition to the development server where we test our changes, we also have our main server, called the Production server. This is the server
                    that all of the users will see and the one that you want zero interruptions for, which is why it is often called the "Live Server". When working at a company as a
                    devops engineer, the production server going down is the absolute worst-case, DEFCON 1, nightmare scenario. Everyone from the customers, to the upper management at
                    your organization will be breathing down your team's neck, wondering only 2 things: When will it be back up? and Who is responsible so they can be reprimanded. It is
                    necessary to implement proper test and security to ensure it is always running.

                    Dockerhub is a repository service hosted by Docker that easily allows us to find and share container images. To push an image to Dockerhub, all we need to do is first name
                    a local image using our Dockerhub username as well as the repo that was created via the Dockerhub site. It is also possible to add multiple docker images to a repo by utilizing
                    tags. Pushing an image is done via the following command: docker push [hub-user]/[repo-name]:[tag]
